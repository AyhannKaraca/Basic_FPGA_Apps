# Basic_FPGA_Apps
Some simple work I did while learning FPGA programming.

While doing these exercises, I used this playlist from Mehmet Burak Aykenar's YouTube channel. 
Here,(https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLZyLAHn509339oyv3vi-3Gdyb8bfPx7Ro) these exercises are done with VHDL. In this repository, I have done these exercises
with SystemVerilog in some projects with some minor changes. I would like to thank Mehmet Burak Aykenar for this nice playlist.
